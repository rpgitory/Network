A17. USB wireless network adapter, wired network adapter


Q18. Firewire is recognized by D- shape. This type of connection is becoming more popular on desktops and laptops and is commonly associated with attaching peripheral devices, such as digital cameras and printers, rather than network connections. **
A18. False


Q19. MT-RZ stands for______________. This is a fibre optic cable connector. It used the launched ___________ connections. And it has a small form factor for high packed density.
A19. Mechanical Transfer Register Jack, push-pull connection


Q20. ST stands for ________ is a half twist pair net type of lock. And is commonly used with single mode fibre optic cable.
A20. Straight Strip


Q21. _______________ is also a fibre optic connector. It uses a jack similar to the RJ-45. This type of connector is commonly used between floors in a building. And stands for ____________
A21.  LC connector, Lucent Connector


Q22. __________ uses push-pull connectors similar to audio and video plugs. And like the LC connector this is also commonly used between floors in a building. And stands for ________
A22.  SC connector, subscribe Connector


Q23. The term serial refers to sending data one bit at a time. Serial cables are cables that carry serial data transmission and a most common form of serial cables used the RS-232 standards which uses the common D shaped connectors such as a DB-9 and DB-25. (True/False)
A23. True 


Q24. The point that a connectors join, light is transmitted from one connector to the other connector but at that point light passes through the other connector it will reflect back in the opposite direction towards the light source and as this happens there is signal loss. This is what happens in UPC connectors. Light is reflected directly back. (True/False)
A24. True


Q25. As a technology progressed new connectors were developed to decrease the signal loss and that is called the ____________. **
A25. APC


Q26. What is the difference between the UPC and APC?
A26. Angle of end face or a tip where the connection is made


Q27. With the___________, the light reflects back towards the light source. But with the _________ with its angle connections the light doesn’t reflect back towards the light source it reflects back to the angle to the wall of a cable as a result it greatly reduces the signal loss. **
A27. UPC, APC
