Q1 What do you mean by “TOPOLOGY”?
A. It is a structure of network how all components connected with each other.

Q2 Name the most common Topology?
A.Star, bus, hybrid, mash, tree

Q3 In ___________ topology the computers are connected to the central wiring point such as a Hub or a Switch.
A. star

Q4 data on Star Network  passes through the _________ point before continuing to its destination.
A. center

Q5 The major benefits of Star  topology is that if  one computer failed or if there was a break in a cable the other computers will  not be affected. Why?
A. if node computer is failed then there is not a problem with another computer although if central computer failed then all computer will disconnected with each other.

Q6 Major disadvantage of a star topology is that if the central hub or switch fails, the other computers on that central point would be affected and this is called a ?
A. If hub or central system failed then entire network will down
	
Q7 What happens if we have Single Point of Failure?
A.if it happened in ring topology then entire network will disconnected.

Q8 Name the network topology where  computer devices and network devices are connected to a single cable? 
A. BUS

Q9 Backbone of Bus Topology is known as?
A. coaxial 

Q10 In Bus Topology, the  computers are connected with this cable using special connectors called BNC which are also known as ?
A. T connector

Q11 One of the advantages of the bus topology is ?
A. easy to setup

Q12 However the disadvantage of the bus topology is that it requires that the cable be terminated at both ends using ?
A. if the main cable broke down then it will create outage in entire network.

Q13 If a computer is removed or added or if terminators are loose or missing then the cable would be open and data will bounce back and this is known as ? 
A. signal reflection 

Q14 What happens if we have signal-reflection?
A. if computer is removed or added or if terminator are loose or missing then the cable would be open and data will bounce back and this known as signal reflection 

Q15 Name the type of network configuration where each computer is connected to each other and shaped of a closed loop or ring so every computer on this ring has exactly two neighbors
A. ring topology

Q16 The advantage of ring topology is that it is easy to ?
A. easy to build up 

Q17 The dis-advantage of ring topology ?
A. one connection break then it will disconnect network however it can loop back and connect to network 

Q18 Name a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected with one another?
A. mesh

Q19 In Mesh Topology each computer on the network connects to every other computer on the network so by having so many connections it handles_____ very well.
A.far

Q20 Mesh Topology  setup allows for most transmissions to be distributed even if ___ of the connections goes down. 
A. one

Q21 Mesh Topology  is  commonly used for?
A.high redundancy, WAN

Q22 Mesh Topology can be expensive due to ?
A. many connection

Q23 Due to expensive Mesh Topology is rarely used in _________ Area Network.
A. LAN

Q24 Mesh Topology is mainly used in _______ Area Network.
A. WAN

Q25 Name a perfect example of Mesh Topology?
A. internet
	
Q26 The advantage of Mesh Topology is it creates a ?
A. even if one connection lose it will regenerate a path using mesh network.

Q27 Will computers still be able to communicate In Mesh Topology what happens if One or more connections fail? (YES /NO)
A.Yes

Q28 Topologies can also be combined with other topologies if needed and these were known as ?
A. Hybrid

Q29 Name the  most common form of hybrid topologies 
A. Bus, star

Q30 In a Star Bus network ________ star topologies linked together using a single cable bus connection.
A. two

Q31 In a Star Ring network_________ring networks are linked together to form a large link network.  
A. two or more

Q32 In Point to Point Topology are two hosts that are directly connected to each other using______.
A. single cable

Q33 These hosts could be____?
A. router, switches

Q34 In A Client Server Topology  clients connect directly to a ____________to access resources rather than connecting to each other.
A. server

Q35 Why do a lot of businesses use this Client Server  topology?
A. bcz it does not have to put all resources on each computer

Q36 Point to Multipoint Topology is a network architecture that is commonly used in _________outdoor network.
A. wireless

Q37 In _________ you would have a central wireless base station and there would be other wireless locations around it that connect to the single central location.
A. what

Q38 In Point to Multipoint Topology , these other locations would directly communicate to the other locations. (YES/NO)
A. No

Q39 In Point to Multipoint Topology , the wireless locations were called clients and a central location is commonly called an access point or a________?
A. base station

Q40 _________Topology is where all the clients on the network talk their every other client on the network to share their resources with each other.
A. peer to peer

Q41 In Peer to Peer Topology ,one computer can share their printer, another computer can share their file on their hard drive and so on.(True/False)?
A. True

Q42 In Peer to Peer Topology , there is no centralized server that the clients connect to.(True / False)?
A. True

Q43 Peer to Peer  topology is simple to set up. You will typically find them in homes and small businesses.(True /False)?
A. True
