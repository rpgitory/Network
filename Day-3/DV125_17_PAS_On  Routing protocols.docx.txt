Q1. A loopback interface is a virtual interface created on a_____________
A1. router


Q2. In terminal when we are in configuration mode we need to enter __________key for interface
A2.  int loopback0


Q3. A routing table is a file that contains a set of __________that shows information on what path a data packet takes to its destination 
A3.  rules


Q4. What does a basic routing table contain? **
A4. A network destination, subnet mask, default gateway, loopback address, interface, next hop, metric


Q5. In order data to travel across a network and reach its destination, it needs a map to determine the best path to take and a way it does this is using a ______protocols
A5. routing


Q6. Routing protocols collect information about the current network status and map out the best path for ______________to take to their specific destination. 
A6. data


Q7. What are the types of routing protocols? **
A7. 3, distance factor, link state, hybrid


Q8. Distance vector protocols are factors in distance to the destination based on how many hops. (True/False)
A8. True


Q9. RIP stands for______________ 
A9. Routing information protocol


Q10. RIP is the oldest routing protocol. Routers that uses RIP, broadcasts their routing information to other routers in every 30 seconds (True/False)
A10. True


Q11. Why did the developers create RIPv2?
A11. bcz of excessive broadcast traffic that RIPv1 caused

A12.1. routing 


Q13. Link state is a routing protocol that is used by_____________ to share information and independently map out the best path on a network. 
A13.  router
